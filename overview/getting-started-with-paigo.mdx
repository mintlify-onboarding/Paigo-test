First, create an account with Paigo by [connecting with sales team](mailto:team@paigo.tech), or [sign up for Free Trial Plan](https://paigo.tech/free-trial). With account credentials, navigate to [Paigo dashboard](https://auth.paigo.tech/login?state=hKFo2SB4WVdKS1IyXzUtaDd5N1RGRkxRa05IWUJ4ZDU0YnJTc6FupWxvZ2luo3RpZNkgWkc1QlctUm9hVlpuVlVPNlZadHIzTmVKZGZHSHFIMWqjY2lk2SBSQTdMaDZOdElPdzhkVUMwRTlEWnBlcXdha0l5Z2ZoTA&client=RA7Lh6NtIOw8dUC0E9DZpeqwakIygfhL&protocol=oauth2&scope=openid&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.prod.paigo.tech%2Fusers%2Fredirect&session=false&property=user) and login.

## Billing Setup

There are a few resources to be created for setting up billing: a dimension, an offering and a customer.

### Dimension

Dimension defines a product metric that is used for billing purpose. Navigate to **Dimension** tab and click on **New Dimension**. In the form, first provide a dimension name, such as `Data Processed`. In the **Usage Measurement** dropdown, choose `Skip / API-based Measurement`, then click **Continue**. Set value for the following fields with value suggested, and leave everything else as default. Click **Submit** on the top right corner to save.

| Field                                                                                            | Value                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Consumption Unit                                                                                 | Gigabyte (Data)                                                                                                                                        |
| Consumption Price                                                                                | $0.08                                                                                                                                                  |

This dimension keeps track of the amount of data processed for a particular customer in terms of gigabytes. The dimension also defines how bills are calculated with those fields related to aggregations etc. See screenshot below for an example.

### Offering

Offering defines a pricing plan that customers subscribe to. Navigate to **Offering** tab and click on **New Offering**. In the form, provide an **Offering Name**, such as `Pay-as-you-go`. Under the **Usage Dimension** dropdown, select the dimension just created above. Click **Submit** on the top right corner to save. See screenshot below for an example.

![image](/images/offering_image.png)

### Customer 

Customer defines the identity that will be billed. Navigate to **Customer** tab and click on **New Customer**. In the form, fill in all the required fields, and leave other fields with default values. Note the following fields:

* **Stripe Payment Account ID**: it should be the account ID found in Stripe Dashboard, in the form of  usually located at the bottom right corner of the Stripe Settings page. Note that in this step, we are taking the SaaS customer's Stripe account, which will be used to make payment. For demonstration purpose, you can use a fake Stripe account ID such as `acct_1MV2hfFMNNPXLiB`. 

* **Offering**: select the offering `Pay-as-you-go` created above from the dropdown. By selecting this offering, this customer's usage will be billed based on the pricing detailed defined in the offering.

Click **Submit** on the top right corner to save. See screenshot below for an example.

Now we have set up all the necessary resources for billing. Next we are going to get some sample data to mock the usage of customer `Dumm AI Corp`!

## Collect Usage

Paigo provides a powerful usage measurement and collection engine to measure SaaS customer's usage of software in real-time and collect them to Paigo backend. In this guide, we are going to use Paigo dashboard to create usage record and also use a sample script for sending mocked usage data to Paigo. Recall in the above steps, we have created a dimension called `Data Processed`. So in this step, we are going to send the data size processed continuously with some interval to mock the behavior of a hypothetical application.

### Using Dashboard

From Paigo Dashboard, usage data can be recorded without writing code. Navigate to **Customer** tab and select the customer `Dumm AI Corp` from the table. In the customer view, scroll down to **Usage Monitoring** and click on the **Record Usage** button. In the **Record Usage** form, the fields of **Customer ID** and **Dimension ID**, are all prefilled. Set value for the following fields with suggested value:

| Field                                                                                            | Value                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Record Value                                                                                 | 0.8                                                                                                                                       |
| Timestamp                                                                               | Leave as default (current time)                                                                                                                                             |
| Record Metadata (Key)                                                                               | Foo                                                                                                                                           |
| Record Metadata (Value)                                                                               | Bar                                                                                                                                          |

Click on **Add Metadata** to add the key-value pair to metadata. See screenshot below for an example.

In the **Preview Record Code Snippet** section down below, the code to create the same usage record is provided. Click on the **Copy** button on the top right corner of **Preview Record Code Snippet** to copy the code. Click **Submit** button to submit the usage record.

At this point, we have already posted exactly one usage record for the service specified. Now let's explore more automated way to continuously collect usage data.

### Using Script 

Paigo API can be used to measure and collect usage data for SaaS application. In this guide, we are using a sample script to demonstrate how it works with Paigo's [API-based Method](). There are more intelligent methods of usage measurement documented in [Measure and Collect Usage Data at Scale]() chapter. Download the below script to a local machine as `ingestToPaigo.js` and modify the **4** lines marked with **TODO** as the instruction below.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Javascript (Node JS)
// npm i cross-fetch --save
const fetch = require("cross-fetch");

const sleep = time => new Promise(res => setTimeout(res, time, "done sleeping"));

const ingestToPaigo = async () => {
    const authResponse = await fetch('https://auth.paigo.tech/oauth/token', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            "audience": "https://qnonyh1pc7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
            "grant_type": "client_credentials",
            "client_id": "client_id", // TODO
            "client_secret": "client_secret" // TODO
        })
    })
    const bearerToken = JSON.parse(await authResponse.text()).access_token;
    for (let i = 0; i < 120; i++) {
        await postUsageRecord(bearerToken);
        await sleep(1000);
    }
    console.log(bearerToken);
};

const postUsageRecord = async (bearerToken) => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.prod.paigo.tech/usage', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + bearerToken,
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            "timestamp": new Date().toISOString(),
            "customerId": "customerId", // TODO
            "dimensionId": "dimensionId", // TODO
            "recordValue": "1",
            "metadata": {}
        })
    })
    console.log(await response.text());
};

ingestToPaigo();
```

```python Python 
# python3 -m pip install requests
import requests
import json
from time import sleep
from datetime import datetime
   
def post_usage_record(bearer_token):
    current_time = datetime.utcnow().replace(microsecond=0).isoformat() + "Z"
    response = requests.post('https://api.prod.paigo.tech/usage', 
        headers={
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + bearer_token,
        },
        data=json.dumps({
            "timestamp": current_time,
            "customerId": "customerId", // TODO
            "dimensionId": "dimensionId" // TODO,
            "recordValue": "1",
            "metadata": {}
        })
    )
    print(response.text)

def ingest_to_paigo():
    auth_response = requests.post('https://auth.paigo.tech/oauth/token', 
        headers={
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        data=json.dumps({
            "audience": "https://qnonyh1pc7.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
            "grant_type": "client_credentials",
            "client_id": "client_id", // TODO
            "client_secret": "client_secret" // TODO
        })
    )
    bearer_token = json.loads(auth_response.text)['access_token']
    for _ in range(120):
        post_usage_record(bearer_token)
        sleep(1)

ingest_to_paigo()
```

</CodeGroup>

* **Client ID**: the client id used for authentication. Should be provided when signing up.

* **Client Secret**: the client secret used for authentication. Should be provided when signing up.

* **Customer ID**: navigate to **Customer** tab in Paigo dashboard and click in the table the `Dumm AI Corp` customer profile just created in the step above. In the customer view, copy the **Customer ID** in the customer information widget and paste it on the line marked with `customerId`. It should be in the form of UUID.

* **Dimension ID**: navigate to **Dimension** tab in Paigo dashboard and click in the table the `Data Processed` dimension just created in the above step. In the dimension view, copy the **Dimension ID** and paste it on the line marked with `dimensionId`. It should be in the form of UUID.

Save the script and run locally with the following command:

``` node ingestToPaifo.js ```

This script first authenticates with Paigo API, then sends a number that mimics the amount of data processed every 1 second to Paigo server. The script will stop by itself after 120 seconds. 

Now we have some usage data collected, we are going to see how Paigo can leverage them for billing.

## Usage Analytics and Invoicing

Once the usage data gets measured and collected to Paigo backend, they can be viewed and visualized as the usage history of a customer. Navigate to **Customer** tab and select the `Dumm AI Corp` from the table. From the customer profile view, the **Usage Monitoring** widget shows the live-streamed usage data that was just sent from the above step to Paigo backend. See below screenshot for an example.

![image](/images/usage_monitoring_image.png)

Next, we are going to explore the usage data collected in aggregated form and raw form. In the same customer profile view, navigate to **Usage Data** widget on the page. By default, the raw usage data collected in the current month will be shown in the usage data table. See below screenshot for an example.

![images](/images/usage_data_image.png)

Alternatively, set **Aggregation** as `Daily` and click **View**. Now all of the usage data are grouped by day, and all data points in the same day are added together to calculate the sum, because in the dimension configuration, we have set the **Aggregation Method** as sum. See screenshot below for an example.

![image](/images/browse_usage_image.png)

With usage data measured and collected by Paigo as such, at the end of a billing cycle, Paigo will automatically aggregate all the usage attributed to a customer, generate a tax-compliant invoice for review, and process payment for the bill. We are going to run an off-cycle invoice to bill customers based on their usage so far.

In the same customer profile view, click on the **Off-cycle Invoice** button in the **Invoice** widget. At the invoice creation form, you can choose to **Manually Enter Line Items** to invoice customers on, or just **Select Billing Period** for Paigo to bill customers based on the corresponding usage. The default dates for billing period is this current calendar month so far. Click the **Submit** button to create an off-cycle invoice for the usage occurred so far. See the screenshot below for an example.

![image](/images/new_invoice_image.png)

Once an invoice is generated, select the invoice draft from the **Invoice Table** at the bottom of the **Customer** profile page, and click on **Actions -> Download** to view the invoice. You can also choose to perform other actions on the invoice from the same menu.

Other use case of the usage data ingested including usage-based cost analytics, margin analysis, pricing optimization, etc.
