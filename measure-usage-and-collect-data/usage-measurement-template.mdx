**New Feature Announcement**

Paigo has introduced native Azure Usage Measurement support! See detailed documentation from [Virtual Machine Compute Time on Azure (Measurement Template)](/measure-usage-and-collect-data/infrastructure-based-method#virtual-machine-compute-time-on-azure-measurement-template)and [Managed Disk on Azure (Measurement Template)](/measure-usage-and-collect-data/infrastructure-based-method#managed-disk-on-azure-measurement-template)

### Overview

Usage measurement templates are predefined sets of configurations of measurements and dimensions for commonly used SaaS product usage. For example, compute time is a commonly defined product metric by many infrastructure SaaS business. Paigo has several templates for compute time measurement and dimension configurations. See below table for the supported usage measurement templates.

| Template Name                                                                                                                                                 | Status  | Platform   | Method         | Description                                                           |

### Measurement Properties and Predefined Values

Following properties are measurement properties and their values predefined for the templates:

* **Measurement Frequency** The frequency that Paigo measures the usage as the atomic usage data.

* **Precision** The precision of atomic usage data Paigo measures.

Once a measurement is used to populate usage data for a dimension, the dimension configuration is automatically decided based on the configuration of measurement. For example, if the measurement is measuring the compute time, then the dimension unit can only be time-based unit such as Hour. Any other value such as gigabyte will be rejected as invalid.

The Following properties are dimension properties and their values predefined for the templates.

* Unit

* Aggregation Method

* Aggregation Interval

* Usage Increment

* Rounding
