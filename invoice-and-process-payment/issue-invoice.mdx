### Automatic and Manual Invoice

At the end of each billing cycle, an automatic invoice will be generated for each customer for their total usage occured in the past billing cycle. The automatic invoice will aggregate all the usage by a particular customer across different services, offerings and dimensions. See [Configure Invoices](/invoice-and-process-payment/issue-invoice#configure-invoices) to understand how automatic invoices are generated.

Business can choose to create manual invoice. Navigate to **Customers** tab and select a customer from the customer table. At the top of the page, click **Off-Cycle Invoice** to generate one-off invoices manually. There are two ways to generate off-cycle invoices, by **Manually Enter Line Items** on the invoice, or by **Selecting Billing Period** and bill customers based on their real usage as line items on the invoice.

Both automatic and manual invoices can be edited when they are in draft status.

### Configure Invoices

Below is an invoice example marked with important fields that can be configured by SaaS business.

**Logo**: The business logo can be configured in **Setting** \> **Invoice** \> **Logo Image**. The best size of a logo image would be 60 pixels x 60 pixels ( or 0.2 inch x 0.2 inch). If logo image is not set, the logo section will be empty on invoices.

2. 2.  
**Business Name and Addresses:** Basic business information can be configured in **Setting** \> **Company**. If business information is not set, this section will be empty on invoices. It is highly recommended to properly set those information for the invoice to be fully tax compliant.

It is highly recommended to properly set those information for the invoice to be fully tax compliant. See [Manage Customer Profile](/pricing-and-subscription/manage-customer-profile) chapter for full documentation on configuring customer information.

4. 4.  
**Line Items**: For automatic invoices, the line items are the **Dimensions** of the offering that the customer has subscribe to. Each dimension will be a line item on the invoice, with the dimension name, aggregated usage quantity, unit price and subtotal dollar amount of the dimension usage. For manual invoices, all the line items can be manually entered.

5. 5.  
**Invoice Date**: For automatic invoices, the invoice date is the end of billing cycle. For manual invoices, the date can be set explicitly.

6. 6.  
**Due Date**: When the invoice payment is due. It is decided by the payment term of invoices. Payment term can be configured in **Setting** \> **Invoice** \> **Invoice Payment Terms**. With the payment terms set, the due date on the invoice will be automatically calculated, as the days after the invoice date.

### Issue Payment

Customer profiles in Paigo are required to have payment information entered when they are created. When an invoice is approved and sent to customers, Paigo automatically processes payment as a direct charge with the payment information available on the customer profile. For instance, with Stripe, Paigo issues a direct charge from SaaS business to customers via Stripe Direct Charge. For more information on payment, see [Process Payment with Stripe](/invoice-and-process-payment/process-payment-with-stripe) chapter.
